# About

Parsley is an addon for the [`discordgo`](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) Discord client library for Go, adding an automatic command parser & dispatch system.

Bot authors can write commands for their Parsley-powered bots by implementing a handler function, taking two arguments - the `MessageSent` event from `discordgo`, and an arbitrary struct of their own choosing.
Parsley will then, on receipt of a message with a matching command, perform reflection on the provided handler and automatically populate the struct via the user's provided arguments, calling the handler with the resulting value.

Parsley was initially built as [`borik`](/projects/borik)'s command parser, but was spun out into it's own library. It was heavily inspired by [`discord.py`'s commands extension](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ext/commands/commands.html).
