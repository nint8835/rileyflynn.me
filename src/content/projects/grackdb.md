# About

Initially written as a project to experiment with [Ent](https://entgo.io/), GrackDB is a graph database modelling and tracking the wide variety of projects my friends and I have worked on, and their relationships.
This database is exposed via a comprehensive, auto-generated GraphQL API, with a frontend using it built by [Jack Harrhy](https://jackharrhy.com/).

# Related projects
