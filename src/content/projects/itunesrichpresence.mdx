# About

iTunesRichPresence is a desktop application for Windows that integrates Discord's Rich Presence functionality with iTunes. With it, other Discord users will be able to see what music you are currently listening to, much like they can with the official Spotify integration.

iTunesRichPresence is written in C#, and uses WPF (with [`MahApps.Metro`](https://mahapps.com/)) for the UI. For interaction with iTunes, it makes use of the official COM interfaces provided by Apple for interacting with iTunes on Windows systems.

As of July 2022, iTunesRichPresence has reached 50,000 downloads on it's most recent release, and nearly a cumulative 60,000 downloads across all releases.
It's official Discord server has over 300 members.
