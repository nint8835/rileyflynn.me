Thank you for attending my talk! I hope regardless of your prior experience with Docker, you learned something from it.

If you've got further questions or want to discuss the content further:

- I'll be heading to the CTS-NL meetup at [Jumping Bean on Elizabeth Avenue](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kYZtadT5uXdfazm86) after the talk, feel free to join me there.
    - Can't make it this week? The meetup occurs every Thursday, 7 to 9 PM, and I'm there most weeks.
- Join the [CTS-NL Discord](http://discord.ctsnl.ca).
- My presence elsewhere on the internet can be found on [my site](https://rileyflynn.me).
